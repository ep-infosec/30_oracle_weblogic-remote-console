    <p>For each XML entity cache, you can monitor a set of statistics that
    describes how the cache is being used and its effectiveness. These
    statistics describe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The current state of the cache, such as how much memory and disk
      space is currently being used, the current number of entries in the
      cache, and so on.</li>
      <li>The cumulative activity for the current session, typically since the
      server started, such as the total number of entries that have lived in
      the cache, the total number of memory and disk page purges, and so
      on.</li>
      <li>The cumulative activity since the cache was created. The type of
      data is the same as the cumulative activity for a session, although the
      numbers reflect historical data since the cache was created.</li>
    </ul>
